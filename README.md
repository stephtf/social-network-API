# Social Network API

## Description 
This project provides the API for a social network application while using MongoDB to store data. The collections of the application include users, thoughts, and reactions. Users create an account with a username and emailaddress. They are able to share their thoughts by posting "thought" messages, which are linked to their usernames. Once a thought it posted, other users can post their reactions to the thought. The number of thoughts and reactions are counted in each respective collection. In addition to reacting to thoughts, users can create a friend list.
